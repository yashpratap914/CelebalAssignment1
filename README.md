As part of my internship task assignment, I successfully implemented three Python codes to generate different geometric patterns using the "*" character. The first code created a lower triangular pattern, where the "*" characters formed a triangle shape with the base aligned horizontally. The second code produced an upper triangular pattern, with the "*" characters forming a triangle shape with the apex aligned at the top. Lastly, the third code generated a pyramid pattern, where the "*" characters were arranged in a symmetric shape resembling a pyramid structure. These coding exercises allowed me to practice my logical thinking, pattern recognition, and algorithmic skills, enhancing my proficiency in Python programming and problem-solving techniques.
